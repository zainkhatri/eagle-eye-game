# Eagle Eye Game

**Eagle Eye Game** is an interactive, machine learning-powered game where players must quickly find specific targets on a grid. The game sharpens attention to detail and reaction time by using machine learning algorithms to dynamically adjust the challenge based on player performance. This repository contains both the JavaScript (`MLGame.js`) and CSS (`MLGame.css`) files responsible for the gameâ€™s functionality and interface.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: The game leverages machine learning to analyze player performance and adjust the difficulty accordingly.
- **Interactive Design**: Provides a clean, user-friendly interface that adjusts to various screen sizes and devices for a consistent experience.
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: The game grid dynamically resizes, ensuring compatibility with desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Offers immediate feedback based on player actions, enhancing user engagement and learning.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures smooth gameplay across different browsers with consistent styling and functionality.

## How It Works

### JavaScript (`MLGame.js`)

The `MLGame.js` file contains the core logic of the game, including:

1. **Game Initialization**: Sets up the game board and dynamically generates targets.
2. **Player Interaction**: Handles user inputs such as clicks on the targets and provides feedback based on performance.
3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Utilizes basic machine learning techniques to adjust the difficulty based on the player's success rate.
4. **Real-Time Scoring**: Tracks player scores and provides instant feedback based on their actions.

### CSS (`MLGame.css`)

The `MLGame.css` file is responsible for the visual layout and user interface, including:

1. **Game Grid**: Defines a flexible and responsive grid layout for the player to interact with targets.
2. **Buttons and Animations**: Styles interactive elements like buttons and provides smooth loading animations.
3. **Text and Feedback**: Styles fonts, colors, and spacing for in-game feedback, messages, and instructions.
